# The-Gryphon-Foam-Dart-Blaster
The Gryphon is a mostly 3D printable, hobby-grade, Nerf semi-automatic flywheel blaster. Its main design features are as follows:

* Uses 130 to 180 sized (20.4mm , brushed DC motors.
* Semi-auto by rack and pinion with 1:3 gear multiplication. The trigger pull is fairly short at 12mm.
* Accepts 33 to 38mm OD flywheels (all 2mm shaft fit, superstock upgrade flywheels).
* Utilizes a horizontal flywheel cage that bolts directly onto the magwell. This is a mounting pattern less prone to misalignment than a Stryfe's mounting bosses or similar.
* Accepts only Worker Talon magazines at the moment, and therefore, only half-length darts. Subject to change, possibly soon.
* Battery is located in the stock--there is no room anywhere else.
* Full-length feed guide integrated in magwell for maximum feeding reliability.
* 14mm bore flywheel cages.
* Bore-axis is almost as close as possible to top rail of blaster, which is theoretically more intuitive to aim with.
* Will fit on build volume as small as 120 mm^3.
* Some options/variable features are:

* Variable motor center distances from 43.5mm to 38.5mm (Eclipse).'
* Full-length, flat-top picatinny rail.
* Ambidextrous, or one-sided sling mounts.
* A mag release meant to be actuated by the operator's off-hand, and one meant for the dominant hand's middle finger.
* Flash hider: Helps work around cover, and can be used to house and launch a mega dart.
* Kill-switch mount on stock, and a kill-switch + voltmeter mount on stock.

Required for assembly:

* Two 130-180 sized motors.
* 33 to 38mm, 2mm shaft fit flywheels
* 16-18 AWG multi-strand hobby wire
* Connectors of choice (XT60, Deans, bullet connectors), and heat shrink.
* One full-sized microswitch, 15A or 21A.
* M3 nuts
* M3 screws: 5mm length, 8mm length, 10mm length, one 14-16mm length for mag release pivot, one 20mm length for one specific screw on the motor cover.
* M2 screws: 4-5mm length for motor mounting.
* 0.5mm coil thickness, 5mm diameter compression springs. 15mm in length for the mag release, 50mm in length for the trigger return spring.
* An adhesive for stock assembly, preferably methyl methacrylate based.
* Modular connectors to flywheel cage and to stock assembly (if using kill switch and/or voltmeter) highly recommended.
